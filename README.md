### Hi there, I am Esther 👋 

👩🏻‍🎓 I am a Data Analyst with an MBA in International Management and three years of experience in Project Management for development cooperation and innovation projects. I am passionate about urban mobility and city liveability topics!

🙋🏻‍♀️ Working for international projects exposed me to multicultural environments, where I learned to employ my most versatile and adaptable qualities. I worked under high pressure deadlines, prepared technical and financial proposals, and managed teams of over 5 people. Thus, I strongly developed my communication and teamwork skills, coupled with a strong analytical thinking.

I first got in touch with the world of statistics when doing my bachelor’s degree. This passion came back when I started working as Project Manager for a startup that developed urban mobility solutions. I participated in the development of a product capable of communicating real-time data. Realizing the power of data to help public authorities improve decision-making made me decide to make a switch in my professional career.

📊 In my data analytics experience, I was able to acquire a deep understanding of the processes and tools used in data science by enrrolling in Ironhack´s Data Analyst course. From Python, database management with SQL, and Machine Learning to storytelling and creating visualizations. As a final project, I developed a demand forecasting model to predict the demand of bikes from the City of London sharing system, where besides machine learning and analytics, I scraped data from the public transport for London API to create dynamic maps with Tableau.

🚀 My objective is to apply all the knowledge I learned in innovative organizations that care for employee professional development and that focus on the redesign of cities to overcome urban challenges threatening city liveability.

I am technically proficient in: 
Python | Pandas | Scikit Learn | SQL | Tableau | MS Office Suite | Excel | Canva | Miro| Trello | Machine Learning | Web Scraping

French and Spanish are both my mother tongues, added to a proficiency level in English and intermediate in German.
